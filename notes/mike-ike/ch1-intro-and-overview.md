Qubit is the analogue of classical bit.

Two possible states are $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$. It is possible to form linear combination of states, called a superposition.

$|\psi\rangle =\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex numbers.

$|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are known as **computational basis states** and form an orthonormal basis for this vector space.

When we measure a qubit we measure either the state 0 or 1, with probabilities $|\alpha|^2$ and $|\beta|^2$ respectively.

$|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$ as the probabilities must add to one, geometrically this is a condition that the qubit's state must be normalised to length 1. Thus in general a qubit's state is a unit vector in two dimensions.

Qubit can be realised as:

* different polarisations of a photon
* alignment of nuclear spin in a uniform magnetic field
* the states of an electron orbiting an atom (ground or excited)


Because $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$, we can rewrite $|\psi\rangle =\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$ as:

$$|\psi\rangle=e^{i\gamma}(\cos\frac{\theta}{2}|0\rangle+e^{i\phi}\sin\frac{\theta}{2}|1\rangle)$$
