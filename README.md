I'm hoping to study the basics of quantum computing.

My approach:

* Self-study from resources such as Mike & Ike, MIT OCW lectures, John Preskill's lectures.
* Get practical experience coding quantum circuits using tools such as Qiskit or Cirq.
* Document every step to make revision and progress tracking easier.
